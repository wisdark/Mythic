## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability with Mythic, please reach out via twitter (@its_a_feature_), open an issue on this GitHub repo, or reach out via the Bloodhound Slack to the user @its_a_feature_.

Please make sure you include what the vulnerability/issue is and have either replication steps or a proof of concept for me to look at. 
I'll do my best to reproduce it locally and hopefully get a fix within 48 hours. If it's not something I can easily fix, we can work on a timeline.
I can't offer any cash prize for finding issues, but I can get a swag bag sent out to you.

If it's something that you send privately to me, please don't publicly report it until we're able to determine a fix.
